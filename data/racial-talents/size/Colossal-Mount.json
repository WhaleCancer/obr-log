    "description":  "**Prerequisites:** [Colossal](../../Major-Racial-Talents/Colossal.md) size, Non-Humanoid\nThis race can be used as a mount by other creatures. Members of this race are suitable for riding and can carry riders effectively. This talent allows the race to serve as mounts for other creatures, though the rider must have the appropriate skills (Ride and Mounted Combat) to use them effectively.\nCreatures with this talent are colossal-sized and can carry multiple riders, entire crews, or even structures on their backs comfortably. They are physically capable of supporting massive weight and movement of mounted combatants, and their truly enormous size provides exceptional stability and carrying capacity. This talent is only available to Colossal-sized creatures and cannot be taken by humanoids.\n## Mounted Combat Bonus\nAs a standard side effect of being a mount, creatures with this talent typically provide combat bonuses to their riders. A mounted warrior has certain advantages over a fighter on foot, and adds a special +1 bonus to his attack total in such a situation. If a mounted combatant charges before the attack, there is a special +2 bonus to the damage roll, in addition to any other bonuses applied. This will only apply on the first round, and is granted by the momentum of the charge.\nSome creatures with the Colossal Mount talent may not provide these combat bonuses (as noted in their individual descriptions).\nTo ride a creature with this talent effectively, a Hero must have the Ride special skill. Controlling a mount in battle is a highly skilled task, requiring the Mounted Combat special skill.",
