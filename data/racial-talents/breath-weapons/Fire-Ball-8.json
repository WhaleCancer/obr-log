    "description":  "This race can shoot fire-balls from their mouths, which they send roaring through the air to explode on their target. These can be avoided by a successful Test for LUCK; if they hit they will cause 4 STAMINA points of damage. The creatures can produce one of these every other round, and can shoot them up to twenty-five metres with surprising accuracy.",
