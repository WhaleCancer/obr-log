    "description":  "This talent allows the creature to deliver a massive blast of fire from their body. If the creature successfully hits the same target twice in a row, their next successful strike will deliver an extra 5 points of damage from the fire blast. This represents the creature building up and then releasing a concentrated burst of flame.\nIf the creature is killed on the Earthly Plane, they explode in a burst of flame causing 4 points of damage to anyone within three metres. Targets within range may Test for Luck to avoid the explosion damage.\nThis talent is commonly found among demonic creatures such as Demon Bats, whose infernal nature allows them to channel and release destructive fire energy.",
