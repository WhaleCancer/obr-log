    "description":  "This talent allows the creature to paralyze their opponents through physical contact. If the creature successfully hits the same target with their natural weapons (such as claws) four times, the victim becomes paralyzed and unable to move, speak, or take any actions. The victim\u0027s body goes numb and their breathing becomes constricted. The paralysis typically lasts until the creature is killed or the effect is removed by magical means.\nThis talent is commonly found among undead creatures such as Ghouls, whose unholy touch carries the power to immobilize their prey.",
