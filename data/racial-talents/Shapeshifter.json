    "description":  "This alien race can change their shape (but not their mass) to almost any form. Natural weapons and armour can be mimicked but will not be functional, nor will wings if the original race cannot fly. The alien can, with careful study, take on the appearance of another specific person, but some acting talent would be required to accurately impersonate the target. This shapechange takes between 1 and 3 rounds depending on the extent of the change.",
